        <p style="text-align: center;">"While I had trouble holding on to that sense of fantastical independence engendered by submerging oneself in an act of creation, I maintained my interest in the various forms of it. From a young age, I enjoyed writing, coding, drawing, and, as my happiest memory would have you believe, building among other things. Those passions were part of my crutch in dealing with the aforementioned obsession. I doodled on my assignments, coded frivolous programs, and took every opportunity in my English classes to write in my own style. In this, I can’t help but notice that there’s a crucial aspect of play involved in my envisioning of the act of creation—the wonder and imagination of it. One of my favorite pieces of animation is Redline (2009). Just based on the title, you can guess that it's full of twists and turns and wonder and action. The film’s strength lies more in the bold kinetics of the animation style than its thematic depth, but Redline remains one of my favorites because something about it resonates in me past simple escapism. It follows the events of a race known across interstellar space far into the future as a competition of the highest caliber and danger. The passion and energy held by the competitors and culture surrounding the race lies in contrast to its stage, the world of Roboworld which is controlled by a militaristic government bent on disrupting the race. On the other side, the racers are cunning and ruthless with the simple goal of participating and winning. The chaos of the race itself adds to each vying vector of agency to emphasize how the competitors venture into the undecided—outside of the predeterministic regulation of society with the roles associated with it. Redline champions the bubbly spirit of individualism filled with fervid ambition present in adventure. It inspires a philosophy of having fun with your life through all the mayhem.
